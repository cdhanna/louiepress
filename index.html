                You'll play as Agent Louie, a highly trained Super Operative, as you try to solve level after level, recapturing the world's stolen Ice Cream supply. Indeed, a fiendish Doctor Melt has maliciously stolen the entire Earth's Ice Cream supply, leaving the fair citizens to suffer the heat of summer without respite. You've parachuted onto Doctor Melt's secret island base, and you'll stop at nothing to serve up a dish of ice cold justice.
                It won't be easy. Doctor Melt has surrounded the island with dangerous traps, boiling lava pits, villainous minions, and confusing building architecture.

                If you should finish the campaign, there is also a fully featured level editor for you! Every level in this game was created with the in-game level editor.
