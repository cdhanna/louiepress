        <h4> About </h4>
        <div>
            <p>
                My name is Chris Hanna, and I started working on Louie in November 2018. 
                I've always loved making games, but Louie will be the first one I've ever finished and published.
                I'm responsible for all the programming, the art, and most of the level design. 
                The thing I loved most about making Louie was writing all the shader code. I had fun with it.    
            </p>
            <p>
                Louie is about how an evil villain, Dr. Melt, has stolen the world's ice cream supply! 
                The player takes the role as Agent Absolute Seven Point Zero, Louie. The mission is to recapture all the 
                ice cream and bring Dr. Melt to justice! There are 26 levels in total. 
                The game is heavily inspired by some of my favorite games from growing up, like Secret Agent (1992), Commander Keen (1991), and Hunter Hunted (1996).

        <h4> Description </h4>
        <div>
            <p>
                You'll play as Agent Louie, a highly trained Super Operative, as you try to solve level after level, recapturing the world's stolen Ice Cream supply. Indeed, a fiendish Doctor Melt has maliciously stolen the entire Earth's Ice Cream supply, leaving the fair citizens to suffer the heat of summer without respite. You've parachuted onto Doctor Melt's secret island base, and you'll stop at nothing to serve up a dish of ice cold justice.
                It won't be easy. Doctor Melt has surrounded the island with dangerous traps, boiling lava pits, villainous minions, and confusing building architecture.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you should finish the campaign, there is also a fully featured level editor for you! Every level in this game was created with the in-game level editor.
